Question: When did the concept of sustainable development come into existence?

(excerpt from article: 'Sustainable development') Following the Club of Rome report, an MIT research group prepared ten days of hearings on ""Growth and Its Implication for the Future"" (Roundtable Press, 1973) for the US Congress, the first hearings ever held on sustainable development. William Flynn Martin, David Dodson Gray, and Elizabeth Gray prepared the hearings under the Chairmanship of Congressman John Dingell.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'Sustainable development') In 1980 the International Union for the Conservation of Nature published a world conservation strategy that included one of the first references to sustainable development as a global priority and introduced the term ""sustainable development"". Two years later, the United Nations World Charter for Nature raised five principles of conservation by which human conduct affecting nature is to be guided and judged. In 1987 the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development released the report ""Our Common Future"", commonly called the Brundtland Report. The report included what is now one of the most widely recognised definitions of sustainable development.
 3. (excerpt from article: 'Sustainable development') While the modern concept of sustainable development is derived mostly from the 1987 Brundtland Report, it is also rooted in earlier ideas about sustainable forest management and twentieth-century environmental concerns. As the concept developed, it has shifted its focus more towards the economic development, social development and environmental protection for future generations. It has been suggested that ""the term 'sustainability' should be viewed as humanity's target goal of human-ecosystem equilibrium, while 'sustainable development' refers to the holistic approach and temporal processes that lead us to the end point of sustainability"". Modern economies are endeavoring to reconcile ambitious economic development and obligations of preserving natural resources and ecosystems, as the two are usually seen as of conflicting nature. Instead of holding climate change commitments and other sustainability measures as a remedy to economic development, turning and leveraging them into market opportunities will do greater good. The economic development brought by such organized principles and practices in an economy is called Managed Sustainable Development (MSD).

Question: What is formed on top of continental crust?
Contexts:
 1. (excerpt from article: 'Continental crust') Because the surface of continental crust mainly lies above sea level, its existence allowed land life to evolve from marine life. Its existence also provides broad expanses of shallow water known as epeiric seas and continental shelves where complex metazoan life could become established during early Paleozoic time, in what is now called the Cambrian explosion.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'Pedosphere') The pedosphere lies below the vegetative cover of the biosphere and above the hydrosphere and lithosphere. The soil forming process (pedogenesis) can begin without the aid of biology but is significantly quickened in the presence of biologic reactions. Soil formation begins with the chemical and/or physical breakdown of minerals to form the initial material that overlies the bedrock substrate. Biology quickens this by secreting acidic compounds (dominantly fulvic acids) that help break rock apart. Particular biologic pioneers are lichen, mosses and seed bearing plants, but many other inorganic reactions take place that diversify the chemical makeup of the early soil layer. Once weathering and decomposition products accumulate, a coherent soil body allows the migration of fluids both vertically and laterally through the soil profile, causing ion exchange between solid, fluid and gaseous phases. As time progresses, the bulk geochemistry of the soil layer will deviate away from the initial composition of the bedrock and will evolve to a chemistry that reflects the type of reactions that take place in the soil.

Question: Who has made the most money on jeopardy?

 1. (excerpt from article: 'List of Jeopardy! contestants') Emma Boettcher, a 27-year-old University of Chicago librarian, supplanted James Holzhauer as ""Jeopardy!"" champion on June 3, 2019, preventing him from surpassing the $2.52 million Ken Jennings earned during his 2004 winning streak. Boettcher was the highest-winning female contestant in any single game of ""Jeopardy!"" with $46,801 surpassing the $46,600 Maria Wenglinsky has earned on November 1, 2005. She won three games before losing on the fourth day, winning a total of $98,002. Boettcher's performance was unusual in that most contestants who upset a long-running champion promptly finish in last place in their next episode; only one, Mark Japinga (who ended Ben Ingram's eight-win streak and went on to a four-game win streak of his own), had greater success than Boettcher.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'List of Jeopardy! contestants') James Holzhauer (born July 1984), a professional sports gambler from Las Vegas, Nevada and a native of Naperville, Illinois, set the single-game ""Jeopardy!"" winnings record of $110,914 during his fourth appearance on the show in April 2019, beating the previous record of $77,000 previously held by Roger Craig. He eclipsed his own record on April 17, with a final single-game total of $131,127. He currently holds the top ten single-game winnings records. At $25,000, he also exceeded Philip Tiu's prior record of $19,000 for largest successful Daily Double wager. At $60,013, he exceeded his own prior record of $38,314 for largest successful Final Jeopardy wager of all time. Before James, the record for largest successful Final Jeopardy wager was $34,000 held by Austin Rogers. His $298,687 total winnings across his first five days also surpassed the five-day record set by Frank Spangenberg. He is now the second-highest winning contestant in regular game (non-tournament) winnings, surpassed only by Ken Jennings. In addition to an aggressive wagering strategy, Holzhauer also goes for the highest values on the board first to amass his totals quickly, make it more difficult for his opponents to catch up, and increase the money he has available to wager when he hits a Daily Double. He finally lost on June 3, 2019 to Emma Boettcher, making his 32 wins the second-longest day streak in show history, and his total winnings of $2,462,216 the second most money won in regular-season play. He also has won the third-most money overall in the show as of June 6, 2019, and, counting winnings on all game shows, is third overall after winning the Tournament of Champions in a rematch with Emma. He then went on to participate in the ""Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time"" primetime event , winning one of four matches and finishing second overall behind Ken Jennings.

 2. (excerpt from article: 'Steve Johnson (Days of Our Lives)') Returning to focus his attention on Kayla, Steve found that she was expecting a child. Their happiness was complicated by the arrival of Marina Toscano, who claimed to be Steve's wife. While he had indeed married her, he had thought her long since dead, confessing to Kayla that he believed that he'd killed her during a seaboard fight. Marina made it clear that she didn't want Steve back, she just needed his help getting a key that they'd thrown into the sea. Hoping for a quick divorce, he agreed to help her and went to Italy to get the key. While there, he had to fight off Kiriakis' henchmen when they tried to get the key from him. The fight left him with a broken glass eye. Meanwhile, in Salem, Kayla had had enough of Marina putting her husband and family in danger and the pair got in a fight. Later, Marina turned up dead and Kayla became a key suspect. To make things worse, Kiriakis kidnapped her in a bid to get the key. She was released when Isabella gave the key to Victor. The couple then rushed to get married before she gave birth and she was arrested for Marina's murder during the wedding. Kayla stood trial, thanks largely to doctored evidence that Kiriakis had sent to John Black. She was convicted and gave Steve their newborn daughter, Stephanie, to raise. He hired a nanny, Kelly Parker, who, unfortunately, turned out to be quite crazy and kidnapped the child when Kayla escaped from prison. Steve and Kayla went in pursuit of her, tracking her to Australia where they were lucky enough to find Bo and Hope who helped them track her down. After getting Stephanie back, they had the additional good news that Kayla had been cleared of the murder conviction and they all returned to Salem.

The United States collectively as a country has won a plurality of the series, although from 1969 to 1991 teams from Taiwan dominated the series, winning in 15 out of those 23 years.

For most of the time since then, AustraliaNew Guinea remained a continuous landmass. When the last glacial period ended in about 10,000 BC, rising sea levels formed Bass Strait, separating Tasmania from the mainland. Then between about 8,000 and 6,500 BC, the lowlands in the north were flooded by the sea, separating New Guinea, the Aru Islands, and the Australian mainland.

 3. (excerpt from article: 'England at the FIFA World Cup') There they faced Argentina, in a very fierce game that saw Argentinian Antonio Rattin sent off by German referee Rudolf Kreitlein. Geoff Hurst scored the only goal of the game, and only his second in international football, to give England the win and a place in the semi-finals, where they faced Portugal. Two goals from Bobby Charlton gave England the lead going into the final 10 minutes of the match, before Eusebio scored from the penalty spot in the 82nd minute, the first goal England had conceded in the tournament. The final pitted England against West Germany, who took the lead in the 12th minute through Helmut Haller. Hurst equalised six minutes later, before Martin Peters gave England the lead with 12 minutes left to play; however, in the 89th minute, Wolfgang Weber levelled the scores again to take the match to extra time. In the additional period, Hurst scored twice more, the first crashing down off the crossbar before being given by linesman Tofiq Bahramov, who controversially deemed the ball to have entirely crossed the line. Hurst's three goals made him the first player to score a hat-trick in a FIFA World Cup final, a feat that (as of 2018) has not been matched since.

Question: What do brackets in an chemical equation mean?
Contexts:
 1. (excerpt from article: 'Chemical formula') Molecules with multiple functional groups that are the same may be expressed by enclosing the repeated group in round brackets. For example, isobutane may be written (CH)CH. This condensed structural formula implies a different connectivity from other molecules that can be formed using the same atoms in the same proportions (isomers). The formula (CH)CH implies a central carbon atom connected to one hydrogen atom and three CH groups. The same number of atoms of each element (10 hydrogens and 4 carbons, or CH) may be used to make a straight chain molecule, ""n""-butane: CHCHCHCH.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'Chemical formula') For more complex ions, brackets [ ] are often used to enclose the ionic formula, as in [BH], which is found in compounds such as Cs[BH]. Parentheses ( ) can be nested inside brackets to indicate a repeating unit, as in [Co(NH)]Cl. Here, (NH) indicates that the ion contains six NH groups bonded to cobalt, and [ ] encloses the entire formula of the ion with charge +3. 
 3. (excerpt from article: 'Defining equation (physical chemistry)') Conventionally for concentrations and activities, square brackets [ ] are used around the chemical molecular formula. For an arbitrary atom, generic letters in upright non-bold typeface such as A, B, R, X or Y etc. are often used.

Question: When was the song we are the world recorded?
Contexts:
 1. (excerpt from article: 'We Are the World') The final night of recording was held on January 28, 1985, at A&M Recording Studios in Hollywood. Michael Jackson arrived at 8 pm, earlier than the other artists, to record his solo section and record a vocal chorus by himself. He was subsequently joined in the recording studio by the remaining USA for Africa artists, who included Ray Charles, Billy Joel, Diana Ross, Cyndi Lauper, Bruce Springsteen, and Tina Turner. Also in attendance were five of Jackson's siblings: Jackie, La Toya, Marlon, Randy, and Tito. Many of the participants came straight from an American Music Award ceremony, which had been held that same night. Invited musician Prince, who would have had a part in which he and Michael Jackson sang to each other, did not attend the recording session. The reason given for his absence has varied. One newspaper claimed that Prince did not want to record with other acts. Another report, from the time of ""We Are the World""'s recording, suggested that the musician did not want to partake in the session because organizer Bob Geldof called him a ""creep"". Prince did, however, donate an exclusive track, ""4 The Tears In Your Eyes"", for the ""We Are the World"" album. Eddie Murphy was asked by Wonder to participate, but Murphy turned him down as he was busy recording ""Party All the Time."" Murphy later stated after he ""realized what it was [he] felt like an idiot."" In all, more than 45 of America's top musicians participated in the recording, and another 50 had to be turned away. Upon entering the recording studio, the musicians were greeted by a sign pinned to the door which read, ""Please check your egos at the door."" They were also greeted by Stevie Wonder, who proclaimed that if the recording was not completed in one take, he and Ray Charles, two blind men, would drive everybody home.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'We Are the World') Following Band Aid's 1984 ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"" project in the UK, an idea for the creation of an American benefit single for African famine relief came from activist Harry Belafonte, who, along with fundraiser Ken Kragen, was instrumental in bringing the vision to reality. Several musicians were contacted by the pair, before Jackson and Lionel Richie were assigned the task of writing the song. The duo completed the writing of ""We Are the World"" seven weeks after the release of ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"", and one night before the song's first recording session, on January 21, 1985. The historic event brought together some of the most famous artists in the music industry at the time.

 2. (excerpt from article: 'Spleen') The spleen synthesizes antibodies in its white pulp and removes antibody-coated bacteria and antibody-coated blood cells by way of blood and lymph node circulation. A study published in 2009 using mice found that the red pulp of the spleen forms a reservoir that contains over half of the body's monocytes. These monocytes, upon moving to injured tissue (such as the heart after myocardial infarction), turn into dendritic cells and macrophages while promoting tissue healing. The spleen is a center of activity of the mononuclear phagocyte system and is analogous to a large lymph node, as its absence causes a predisposition to certain infections.

None of these versions saw print, though Captain Marvel, the Wizard Shazam, and Black Adam did appear in DC's ""War of the Gods"" miniseries in 1991. By this time, DC had finally ceased the fee-per-use licensing agreement with CBS Publications and purchased the full rights to Captain Marvel and the other Fawcett Comics characters.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'Captain Marvel (DC Comics)') Fawcett ceased publishing Captain Marvelrelated comics in 1953, partly because of a copyright infringement suit from DC Comics alleging that Captain Marvel was a copy of Superman. In 1972, Fawcett licensed the character rights to DC, which by 1991 acquired all rights to the entire family of characters. DC has since integrated Captain Marvel and the Marvel Family into their DC Universe and has attempted to revive the property several times, with mixed success. Due to trademark conflicts over other characters named ""Captain Marvel"" owned by Marvel Comics, DC has branded and marketed the character using the trademark ""Shazam!"" since his 1972 reintroduction. This led many to assume that ""Shazam!"" was the character's name. DC renamed the mainline version of the character as ""Shazam!"" when relaunching its comic book properties in 2011, and his associates became the ""Shazam Family"".

Question: Who was contracted to design golden gate park?
Contexts:
 1. (excerpt from article: 'Golden Gate Park') In the 1860s, San Franciscans began to feel the need for a spacious public park similar to Central Park, which was then taking shape in New York City. Golden Gate Park was carved out of unpromising sand and shore dunes that were known as the Outside Lands, in an unincorporated area west of San Francisco's then-current borders. Conceived ostensibly for recreation, the underlying purpose of the park was housing development and the westward expansion of the city. The tireless field engineer William Hammond Hall prepared a survey and topographic map of the park site in 1870 and became its commissioner in 1871. He was later named California's first state engineer and developed an integrated flood control system for the Sacramento Valley. The park drew its name from nearby Golden Gate Strait.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'Golden Gate Park') The plan and planting were developed by Hall and his assistant, John McLaren, who had apprenticed in Scotland, home of many of the 19th-century's best professional gardeners. John McLaren, when asked by the Park Commission if he could make Golden Gate Park ""one of the beauty spots of the world,"" replied saying, ""With your aid gentleman, and God be willing, that I shall do."" He also promised that he'd ""go out into the country and walk along a stream until he found a farm, and that he'd come back to the garden and recreate what nature had done."" The initial plan called for grade separations of transverse roadways through the park, as Frederick Law Olmsted had provided for Central Park, but budget constraints and the positioning of the Arboretum and the Concourse ended the plan. In 1876, the plan was almost replaced by one for a racetrack, favored by ""the Big Four"" millionaires: Leland Stanford, Mark Hopkins, Collis P. Huntington, and Charles Crocker. Stanford, who was president of the Southern Pacific Railroad, was also one of the owners of the Ocean Railroad Company, which ran from Haight Street across the park to its south border, then out to the beach and north to a point near Cliff House. It was Gus Mooney who claimed land adjacent to the park on Ocean Beach. Many of Mooney's friends also staked claims and built shanties on the beach to sell refreshments to the patrons of the park. Hall resigned, and the remaining park commissioners followed. In 1882 Governor George C. Perkins appointed Frank M. Pixley, founder and editor of The Argonaut, to the board of commissioners of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. Pixley was adamant that the Mooney's shanties be eliminated, and he found support with the San Francisco Police for park security. Pixley favored Stanford's company by granting a fifty-year lease on the route that closed the park on three sides to competition. The original plan, however, was back on track by 1886, when streetcars delivered over 47,000 people to Golden Gate Park on one weekend afternoon (out of a population of 250,000 in the city).

 2. (excerpt from article: 'Premier League') An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers. UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that if the Champions League winner finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league. At that time, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League. This occurred in 2012, when Chelsea  who had won the Champions League that summer, but finished sixth in the league  qualified for the Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur, who went into the Europa League.

Question: When did health care workers first use chlorine solution to decontaminate hands?
Contexts:
 1. (excerpt from article: 'Chlorine') Labarraque's chlorinated lime and soda solutions have been advocated since 1828 to prevent infection (called ""contagious infection"", presumed to be transmitted by ""miasmas""), and to treat putrefaction of existing wounds, including septic wounds. In his 1828 work, Labarraque recommended that doctors breathe chlorine, wash their hands in chlorinated lime, and even sprinkle chlorinated lime about the patients' beds in cases of ""contagious infection"". In 1828, the contagion of infections was well known, even though the agency of the microbe was not discovered until more than half a century later.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'Chlorine') Perhaps the most famous application of Labarraque's chlorine and chemical base solutions was in 1847, when Ignaz Semmelweis used chlorine-water (chlorine dissolved in pure water, which was cheaper than chlorinated lime solutions) to disinfect the hands of Austrian doctors, which Semmelweis noticed still carried the stench of decomposition from the dissection rooms to the patient examination rooms. Long before the germ theory of disease, Semmelweis theorized that ""cadaveric particles"" were transmitting decay from fresh medical cadavers to living patients, and he used the well-known ""Labarraque's solutions"" as the only known method to remove the smell of decay and tissue decomposition (which he found that soap did not). The solutions proved to be far more effective antiseptics than soap (Semmelweis was also aware of their greater efficacy, but not the reason), and this resulted in Semmelweis's celebrated success in stopping the transmission of childbed fever (""puerperal fever"") in the maternity wards of Vienna General Hospital in Austria in 1847.

Contexts:
 1. (excerpt from article: 'Brine') Saline water with relatively high concentration of salt (usually sodium chloride) occurs naturally on Earth's surface (salt lakes), crust, and within brine pools on ocean bottom.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'Main sequence') The main sequence is sometimes divided into upper and lower parts, based on the dominant process that a star uses to generate energy. Stars below about 1.5 times the mass of the Sun () primarily fuse hydrogen atoms together in a series of stages to form helium, a sequence called the protonproton chain. Above this mass, in the upper main sequence, the nuclear fusion process mainly uses atoms of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen as intermediaries in the CNO cycle that produces helium from hydrogen atoms. Main-sequence stars with more than two solar masses undergo convection in their core regions, which acts to stir up the newly created helium and maintain the proportion of fuel needed for fusion to occur. Below this mass, stars have cores that are entirely radiative with convective zones near the surface. With decreasing stellar mass, the proportion of the star forming a convective envelope steadily increases. Main-sequence stars below undergo convection throughout their mass. When core convection does not occur, a helium-rich core develops surrounded by an outer layer of hydrogen.

Starr claimed that Staley was very sick but would not call 911. They briefly argued, which ended with Starr storming out. Starr stated that Staley called after him as he left and said: ""Not like this, don't leave like this"". Since Staley is believed to have died a day later, on April 5, Starr expressed regret for not calling 911 to save his life. Starr reported that Staley had threatened to sever their friendship if he did, and also stated that he wished he hadn't been high on benzodiazepine that night and wouldn't have just walked out of the door. The interview ended with Starr apologizing to McCallum for not calling 911, but she was insistent that neither she nor anyone in her family blamed Starr for Staley's death. She also told Starr: ""Layne would forgive you. He'd say, 'Hey, I did this. Not you.'"" Starr still blamed himself for the death of Staley. Starr kept this story a secret until his appearance on ""Celebrity Rehab"" in February 2010.

Question: Who was the first person who discovered electricity?
Contexts:
 1. (excerpt from article: 'Electricity') Long before any knowledge of electricity existed, people were aware of shocks from electric fish. Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the ""Thunderer of the Nile"", and described them as the ""protectors"" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients suffering from ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them. Possibly the earliest and nearest approach to the discovery of the identity of lightning, and electricity from any other source, is to be attributed to the Arabs, who before the 15th century had the Arabic word for lightning ""raad"" () applied to the electric ray.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'Electricity') Electricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote ""De Magnete"", in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word ""electricus"" (""of amber"" or ""like amber"", from , ""elektron"", the Greek word for ""amber"") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words ""electric"" and ""electricity"", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's ""Pseudodoxia Epidemica"" of 1646.

Question: What was the writing system of the minoan called?
Contexts:
 1. (excerpt from article: 'Minoan civilization') The Minoans primarily wrote in the undeciphered Linear A and also in undeciphered Cretan hieroglyphs, encoding a language hypothetically labelled Minoan. The reasons for the slow decline of the Minoan civilization, beginning around 1550 BC, are unclear; theories include Mycenaean invasions from mainland Greece and the major volcanic eruption of Santorini.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'Minoan language') The Minoan language is the language (or languages) of the ancient Minoan civilization of Crete written in the Cretan hieroglyphs and later in the Linear A syllabary. As the Cretan hieroglyphs are undeciphered and Linear A only partly deciphered, the Minoan language is unknown and unclassified: indeed, with the existing evidence, it seems impossible to be certain that the two scripts record the same language, or even that a single language is recorded in each. The Eteocretan language, attested in a few alphabetic inscriptions from Crete 1,000 years later, is possibly a descendant of Minoan, but it is itself unclassified.
 3. (excerpt from article: 'Minoan language') Minoan is mainly known from the inscriptions in Linear A, which are fairly legible by comparison with Linear B. The Cretan hieroglyphs are dated from the first half of the 2nd millennium BCE. The Linear A texts, mostly written in clay tablets, are spread all over Crete with more than 40 localities on the island. 
 4. (excerpt from article: 'Linear A') Linear A is a writing system used by the Minoans (Cretans) from 1800 to 1450 BCE to write the hypothesized Minoan language. Linear A was the primary script used in palace and religious writings of the Minoan civilization. It was discovered by archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans. It was succeeded by Linear B, which was used by the Mycenaeans to write an early form of Greek. No texts in Linear A have been deciphered.

Question: Who invented the first efficient incandescent light bulb that was later used in projectors?
Contexts:
 1. (excerpt from article: 'Incandescent light bulb') Prompted by legislation in various countries mandating increased bulb efficiency, ""hybrid"" incandescent bulbs have been introduced by Philips. The ""Halogena Energy Saver"" incandescents can produce about 23 lm/W; about 30 percent more efficient than traditional incandescents, by using a reflective capsule to reflect formerly wasted infrared radiation back to the filament from which it can be re-emitted as visible light. This concept was pioneered by Duro-Test in 1980 with a commercial product that produced 29.8 lm/W. More advanced reflectors based on interference filters or photonic crystals can theoretically result in higher efficiency, up to a limit of about 270 lm/W (40% of the maximum efficacy possible). Laboratory proof-of-concept experiments have produced as much as 45 lm/W, approaching the efficacy of compact fluorescent bulbs.

The role was originally given to Tim Curry, but he developed bronchitis during the initial recording sessions. John Glover, who later voiced the Riddler, also auditioned for the Joker role. Hamill, who found himself to be the biggest fan of the Batman comics among the cast, credited the laughs he had honed on stage in ""Amadeus"" with landing him the role. The recording sessions, under the supervision of voice director Andrea Romano, were recorded with the actors together in one studio instead of taking separate recordings, as is typical. This method would later be employed for all subsequent series in the DC animated universe. Al Pacino was considered to voice Two-Face in the series, but he declined the offer. Other actors included Ron Perlman as Clayface, Roddy McDowall as the Mad Hatter, David Warner as Ra's al Ghul, Michael York as Count Vertigo, Kate Mulgrew as Red Claw, George Murdock as and George Dzundza as the Ventriloquist.

Question: Which type of memory shows a much greater decline with age than others?
Contexts:
 1. (excerpt from article: 'Memory and aging') Normal aging is associated with a decline in various memory abilities in many cognitive tasks; the phenomenon is known as age-related memory impairment (AMI) or age-associated memory impairment (AAMI). The ability to encode new memories of events or facts and working memory shows decline in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Studies comparing the effects of aging on episodic memory, semantic memory, short-term memory and priming find that episodic memory is especially impaired in normal aging; some types of short-term memory are also impaired. The deficits may be related to impairments seen in the ability to refresh recently processed information.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'Memory and aging') Working memory, which as previously stated is a memory system that stores and manipulates information as we complete cognitive tasks, demonstrates great declines during the aging process. There have been various theories offered to explain why these changes may occur, which include fewer attentional resources, slower speed of processing, less capacity to hold information, and lack of inhibitory control. All of these theories offer strong arguments, and it is likely that the decline in working memory is due to the problems cited in all of these areas.

He subsequently became a rotating regular in the second and third series. However he appears only twice in the third series, these being his final appearances. Stephen Fry appears only occasionally on the television series.

(British TV series)') By the end of the tenth series, having run for 136 episodes between 1988 and 1999, Channel 4 decided to axe the programme following the eventual slump in the show's viewing figures. Reruns of ""Whose Line"" continued following its cancellation, though with episodes edited and reformatted as a result. The format itself was later picked up by ABC, after Stiles introduced ""Whose Line"" to Drew Carey, who subsequently pitched an American version of the same name to the TV network with great success.
 3. (excerpt from article: 'Whose Line Is It Anyway? (British TV series)') In 1988, Dan Patterson and Mark Leveson came up with the concept for the show, revolving around games focused on creating improvisational comedy, using a group of performers. As part of their concept, Patterson and Leveson devised the show's title as a comedic riposte to a radio programme that had recently moved to television at the time, ""What's My Line"", merged with the title of a 1972 teleplay (and eventual theatrical play) ""Whose Life Is It Anyway?"". After pitching it to the BBC, the show was given the green light to run as a radio programme on BBC Radio 4 - this early incarnation ran for six episodes, with Clive Anderson as host, and both John Sessions and Stephen Fry as the programme's regulars. During its run, the show's creators decided to adopt the approach used by an earlier BBC radio show, ""I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again"" - rather than having the show's credit read out by a traditional BBC Radio announcer, the performers in each episode were tasked with doing this themselves, but in an amusing, comedic style.

 2. (excerpt from article: 'Democratic Republic of the Congo') In the 1870s, just before the onset of the Scramble for Africa, European exploration of the Congo Basin was carried out, first led by Henry Morton Stanley under the sponsorship of Leopold II of Belgium. Leopold formally acquired rights to the Congo territory at the Berlin Conference in 1885 and made the land his private property, naming it the Congo Free State. During the Free State, his colonial military unit, the ""Force Publique,"" forced the local population to produce rubber. From 1885 to 1908, millions of the Kongo people died as a consequence of disease and exploitation. In 1908, Belgium, despite initial reluctance, formally annexed the Free State, which became known as the Belgian Congo.
 3. (excerpt from article: 'Democratic Republic of the Congo') Lumumba had previously appointed Joseph Mobutu chief of staff of the new Congo army, Armee Nationale Congolaise (ANC). Taking advantage of the leadership crisis between Kasavubu and Tshombe, Mobutu garnered enough support within the army to launch a coup. With financial support from the United States and Belgium, Mobutu paid his soldiers privately. The aversion of Western powers to communism and leftist ideology influenced their decision to finance Mobutu's quest to neutralize Kasavubu and Lumumba in a coup by proxy. A constitutional referendum the year before Mobutu's coup of 1965 resulted in the country's official name being changed to the ""Democratic Republic of the Congo."" In 1971 Mobutu changed the name again, this time to ""Republic of Zaire"".

In the mid-1980s, the Mundialito was held in Italy across four editions with both Italy and England winning two titles.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'FIFA Women's World Cup') Several countries lifted their ban on women's football in the 1970s, leading to new teams being established across Europe and North America. After the first international women's tournaments were held in Asia in 1975 and Europe in 1984, Ellen Wille declared that she wanted better effort from the FIFA Congress in promoting the women's game. This came in 1988 in the form of an invitational tournament in China as a test to see if a global women's World Cup was feasible. Twelve national teams took part in the competition  four from UEFA, three from AFC, two from CONCACAF, and one each from CONMEBOL, CAF and OFC. After the opening match of the tournament between China and Canada was attended by 45,000 people, the tournament was deemed a success, with crowds averaging 20,000. Norway, who was the European champion, defeated Sweden, 10, in the final, while Brazil clinched third place by beating the hosts in a penalty shootout. The competition was deemed a success and on 30 June FIFA approved the establishment of an official World Cup, which was to take place in 1991 again in China.

Question: When did ohio become part of the united states?
Contexts:
 1. (excerpt from article: 'Ohio') The state takes its name from the Ohio River, whose name in turn originated from the Seneca word "" ohiyo"", meaning ""good river"", ""great river"" or ""large creek"". Partitioned from the Northwest Territory, Ohio was the 17th state admitted to the Union on March 1, 1803, and the first under the Northwest Ordinance. Ohio is historically known as the ""Buckeye State"" after its Ohio buckeye trees, and Ohioans are also known as ""Buckeyes"".
 2. (excerpt from article: 'Ohio') On February 19, 1803, U.S. president Thomas Jefferson signed an act of Congress that approved Ohio's boundaries and constitution. However, Congress had never passed a resolution formally admitting Ohio as the 17th state. The current custom of Congress declaring an official date of statehood did not begin until 1812, with Louisiana's admission as the 18th state. Although no formal resolution of admission was required, when the oversight was discovered in 1953, Ohio congressman George H. Bender introduced a bill in Congress to admit Ohio to the Union retroactive to March 1, 1803, the date on which the Ohio General Assembly first convened. At a special session at the old state capital in Chillicothe, the Ohio state legislature approved a new petition for statehood that was delivered to Washington, D.C., on horseback. On August 7, 1953 (the year of Ohio's 150th anniversary), President Eisenhower signed a congressional joint resolution that officially declared March 1, 1803, the date of Ohio's admittance into the Union.

Question: When was the us department of labor created?
Contexts:
 1. (excerpt from article: 'Social programs in the United States') Prior to the Great Depression the United States had social programs that mostly centered around individual efforts, family efforts, church charities, business workers compensation, life insurance and sick leave programs along with some state tax supported social programs. The misery and poverty of the great depression threatened to overwhelm all these programs. The severe Depression of the 1930s made Federal action necessary, as neither the states and the local communities, businesses and industries, nor private charities had the financial resources to cope with the growing need among the American people. Beginning in 1932, the Federal Government first made loans, then grants, to states to pay for direct relief and work relief. After that, special Federal emergency relief like the Civilian Conservation Corps and other public works programs were started. In 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration proposed to Congress federal social relief programs and a federally sponsored retirement program. Congress followed by the passage of the 37 page Social Security Act, signed into law August 14, 1935 and ""effective"" by 1939just as World War II began. This program was expanded several times over the years.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'History of the United States (17761789)') On July 2, 1776, the Second Continental Congress, still meeting in Philadelphia, voted unanimously to declare the independence as the ""United States of America"". Two days later, on July 4, Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence. The drafting of the Declaration was the responsibility of a Committee of Five, which included, among others, John Adams and Benjamin Franklin; it was drafted by Thomas Jefferson and revised by the others and the Congress as a whole. It contended that ""all men are created equal"" with ""certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"", and that ""to secure these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed"", as well as listing the main colonial grievances against the crown. July 4 ever since has been celebrated as the birthday of the United States.

Question: When did the us adopt the electoral college?
Contexts:
 1. (excerpt from article: 'United States Electoral College') The Convention approved the Committee's Electoral College proposal, with minor modifications, on September 6, 1787. Delegates from states with smaller populations or limited land area such as Connecticut, New Jersey, and Maryland generally favored the Electoral College with some consideration for states. At the compromise providing for a runoff among the top five candidates, the small states supposed that the House of Representatives with each state delegation casting one vote would decide most elections.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'United States Electoral College') Although the United States Constitution refers to ""Electors"" and ""electors"", neither the phrase ""Electoral College"" nor any other name is used to describe the electors collectively. It was not until the early 19th century the name ""Electoral College"" came into general usage as the collective designation for the electors selected to cast votes for president and vice president. The phrase was first written into federal law in 1845 and today the term appears in , in the section heading and in the text as ""college of electors"".

Question: When was the king james version of the bible first printed?
Contexts:
 1. (excerpt from article: 'First Epistle to the Thessalonians') The First Epistle to the Thessalonians, commonly referred to as First Thessalonians or 1 Thessalonians, is a Pauline epistle of the New Testament of the Christian Bible. The epistle is attributed to Paul the Apostle, and is addressed to the church in Thessalonica, in modern-day Greece. It is likely the first of Paul's letters, probably written by the end of AD 52 (however, some scholars believe the Epistle to Galatians may have been written at an earlier date: AD 48).
 2. (excerpt from article: 'Bible') The Old Testament canon entered into Christian use in the Greek Septuagint translations and original books, and their differing lists of texts. In addition to the Septuagint, Christianity subsequently added various writings that would become the New Testament. Somewhat different lists of accepted works continued to develop in antiquity. In the 4th century a series of synods produced a list of texts equal to the 39, 46, 51, or 54-book canon of the Old Testament and to the 27-book canon of the New Testament that would be subsequently used to today, most notably the Synod of Hippo in 393 CE. Also ""c"". 400, Jerome produced a definitive Latin edition of the Bible (see Vulgate), the canon of which, at the insistence of the Pope, was in accord with the earlier Synods. With the benefit of hindsight it can be said that this process effectively set the New Testament canon, although there are examples of other canonical lists in use after this time.
