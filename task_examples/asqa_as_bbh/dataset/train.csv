Question: A measure using algorithms to publically protect patient identifiable information is?
Contexts:
 1. (excerpt from article: 'Data masking') Dynamic Data Masking is similar to On-the-Fly Data Masking but it differs in the sense that On-the-Fly Data Masking is about copying data from one source to another source so that the latter can be shared. Dynamic data masking happens at runtime, dynamically, and on-demand so that there doesn't need to be a second data source where to store the masked data dynamically.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'Data masking') On-the-Fly Data Masking happens in the process of transferring data from environment to environment without data touching the disk on its way. The same technique is applied to ""Dynamic Data Masking"" but one record at a time. This type of data masking is most useful for environments that do continuous deployments as well as for heavily integrated applications. Organizations that employ continuous deployment or continuous delivery practices do not have the time necessary to create a backup and load it to the golden copy of the database. Thus, continuously sending smaller subsets (deltas) of masked testing data from production is important. In heavily integrated applications, developers get feeds from other production systems at the very onset of development and masking of these feeds is either overlooked and not budgeted until later, making organizations non-compliant. Having on-the-fly data masking in place becomes essential.

Question: Who wrote trew law and what was it about?
Contexts:
 1. (excerpt from article: 'James VI and I and the English Parliament') In 15978, James wrote two works, ""The Trew Law of Free Monarchies"" and ""Basilikon Doron"" (Royal Gift), in which he established an ideological base for monarchy. In the ""Trew Law"", he sets out the divine right of kings, explaining that for Biblical reasons kings are higher beings than other men, though ""the highest bench is the sliddriest to sit upon"". The document proposes an absolutist theory of monarchy, by which a king may impose new laws by royal prerogative but must also pay heed to tradition and to God, who would ""stirre up such scourges as pleaseth him, for punishment of wicked kings"". ""Basilikon Doron"", written as a book of instruction for the four-year-old Prince Henry, provides a more practical guide to kingship. Despite banalities and sanctimonious advice, the work is well written, perhaps the best example of James's prose. James's advice concerning parliaments, which he understood as merely the king's ""head court"", foreshadows his difficulties with the English Commons: ""Hold no Parliaments,"" he tells Henry, ""but for the necesitie of new Lawes, which would be but seldome"". In the ""True Law"" James states that the king owns his realm as a feudal lord owns his fief, because:
 2. (excerpt from article: 'The True Law of Free Monarchies') The Reciprocal and Mutual Duty Betwixt a Free King and His Natural Subjects (original Scots title: The Trve Lawe of free Monarchies: Or, The Reciprock and Mvtvall Dvtie Betwixt a free King, and his naturall Subiectes) is a treatise or essay of political theory and kingship by James VI of Scotland (later to be crowned James I of England too). It is believed James VI wrote the tract to set forth his idea of kingship, in contrast to the contractarian views espoused by, among others, George Buchanan (in ""De Jure Regni apud Scotos"", 1579). James VI had the work published in 1598. It is considered remarkable for setting out the doctrine of the ""divine right of kings"" in Scotland, and latterly England, for the first time. James saw the divine right of kings as an extension of the apostolic succession.

Question: Where is diamonds are a girl best friend from?
Contexts:
 1. (excerpt from article: 'Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend') The song is also featured in the 2001 film ""Moulin Rouge!"", in which it is sung principally by Nicole Kidman in the role of Satine, the (fictional) star performer of the famous Moulin Rouge nightclub in Paris, at the turn of the 20th century. This film version is technically a musical adaptation that director Baz Luhrmann titled ""Sparkling Diamonds"". Although it consists almost entirely of an adaptation of ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"", this version differs from the lyrics in ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" in several ways. For example, it does not include the name Harry Winston in the chant of famous jewelers; rather, Moulin Rouge founder Charles Zidler's name was changed to Harold in the film, so his name replaces Winston's in the song as ""Harry Zidler"". Black Starr & Frost-Gorham was known by that name only after 1925, but instead of using their 1875-1925 name of ""Black Starr & Frost"", their name was replaced in the Luhrmann film by nonsense words (understood by many listeners as ""Ross Cole;"" in the 2002 DVD release, the words printed in the text captioning are ""Black Star, Roscor""). And the potentially anachronistic line ""help you at the Automat"" was altered in the Luhrmann film to ""help you feed your pussycat."" Additionally, a lyrical snippet from Madonna's song ""Material Girl"" was worked into this adaptation of the song.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend') The song is perhaps most famously performed by Marilyn Monroe in the 1953 film ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"". Monroe's character, Lorelei Lee, has been followed on a Transatlantic ocean liner by a detective hired by her fiance's father, who wants assurance that she is not marrying purely for money. He is informed of compromising pictures taken with a British diamond mine owner and cancels her letter of credit before she arrives in France, requiring her to work in a nightclub to survive. Her fiance arrives at the cabaret to see her perform this song, about exploiting men for riches. Diamonds are an element in another story line in the film, in which Lorelei is given a diamond tiara by the mine owner, in gratitude for her recovering the photographs. In a later scene, Jane Russell, who played opposite Monroe, sang ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"" in court, while pretending to be Lorelei.
 3. (excerpt from article: 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953 film)') Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is a 1953 American musical comedy film based on the 1949 stage musical of the same name. It was directed by Howard Hawks and stars Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe, with Charles Coburn, Elliott Reid, Tommy Noonan, George Winslow, Taylor Holmes and Norma Varden in supporting roles.

Announcers announce each country's name in English, French and the dominant language of the area of the host city, if neither English nor French is the dominant language. Beginning with the 2020 Summer Olympics, the succeeding hosts of the respective Olympic Games (Summer or Winter) will march immediately before the current host in descending order. Therefore, in 2020 (for example), host Japan will follow the United States and France respectively as the final three nations to march. Also, the Refugee Olympic Team will now follow Greece as the second team to enter.

 1. (excerpt from article: 'United KingdomUnited States relations') In early 1775 the Patriots forced all the British officials and soldiers out of the new nation. The British returned in force in August 1776, and captured New York City, which became their base until the war ended in 1783. The British, using their powerful navy, could capture major ports, but 90% of the Americans lived in rural areas where they had full control. After the Patriots captured a British invasion force moving down from Canada in the Saratoga campaign of 1777, France entered the war as an ally of the US, and added the Netherlands and Spain as French allies. Britain lost naval superiority and had no major allies and few friends in Europe. The British strategy was then refocused on the South, where they expected large numbers of Loyalists would fight alongside the redcoats. Far fewer Loyalists took up arms than Britain needed; royal efforts to control the countryside in the South failed. When the British army tried to return to New York, its rescue fleet was turned back by the French fleet and its army was captured by combined French-American forces under General George Washington at the Siege of Yorktown in October 1781. That effectively ended the fighting.

The advantages of pure oxygen blast over air blast was known to Henry Bessemer, but the 19th-century technology was not advanced enough to allow for the production of the large quantities of pure oxygen to make it economically feasible for use.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'Bessemer process') The modern process is named after its inventor, the Englishman Henry Bessemer, who took out a patent on the process in 1856. The process was said to be independently discovered in 1851 by the American inventor William Kelly though the claim is controversial.

Question: Where does rome's drinking water come from?

 1. (excerpt from article: 'Sanitation in ancient Rome') The system in Rome was copied in all provincial towns and cities of the Roman Empire, and even down to villas that could afford the plumbing. Roman citizens came to expect high standards of hygiene, and the army was also well provided with latrines and bath houses, or thermae. Aqueducts were used everywhere in the empire not just to supply drinking water for private houses but to supply other needs such as irrigation, public fountains, and thermae. Indeed, many of the provincial aqueducts survive in working order to the present day, although modernized and updated. Of the eleven ancient aqueducts serving Rome, eight of them entered Rome close to each other on the Esquiline Hill. Also, the first aqueduct was the Aqua Appia built in 312 BC by the censor Appius. Other aqueducts of importance to Roman sanitation was the Aqua Marcia built between 144-140 BC, which provided large amounts of quality water to Rome. One Aqueduct with some major importance to Rome was Traiana, which tapped from the clear springs of the northern and western slopes above lake Bracciano. It is said that the Romans fully appreciated the importance of plentiful and wholesome supply of water, for domestic purposes to health of the Community. It was stated by Amulree that for 441 years after the building of Rome, it depended on water from the Tiber for drinking and other domestic purposes, but in 312 BC Appius Claudius Crassus provide Rome with water from the Springs of the Alban hills and brought to consumers by the means of Aqueducts. The Amulree notes state that this practice is in line with the teachings of Hippocrates: that stagnant water should be refused, not the spring water from the hills or rain water.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'Nasone') In July 2017, Acea began to shut off some nasoni because drought had diminished the nearby Lake Bracciano, the city's main water reserve. The move was criticized by many, citing concerns that the decision will be hurtful to Rome's homeless population and local animals, both of which rely on fresh water from these fountains.

(excerpt from article: 'List of Full House and Fuller House characters') Nicholas ""Nicky"" and Alexander ""Alex"" Katsopolis, (played by Daniel and Kevin Renteria as babies during season five; Blake and Dylan Tuomy-Wilhoit as toddlers for seasons 68) are the twin sons of Jesse and Becky Katsopolis. The two were born in the season five episode ""Happy Birthday, Babies,"" on the date of Michelle's fifth birthday. Becky named Alex after a high school teacher who inspired her to venture into a career in journalism, while Jesse chose to name Nicky after his father, for giving him great hair. They have strawberry-blond hair and are fun-loving toddlers, with minor distinctions between them. Nicky is more quiet and sweet, while Alex is more outspoken and mischievous. They often repeat each other's words.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'List of Full House and Fuller House characters') Jesse Katsopolis (portrayed by John Stamos) is Danny's brother-in-law, Pam's younger brother, making him the maternal uncle to DJ, Stephanie, and Michelle. Later in the series, he also becomes the spouse of Rebecca Donaldson, Danny's co-host on Wake Up, San Francisco, by whom he has two children, twin sons Nicholas and Alexander, better known as Nicky and Alex. The character underwent several name changes throughout the series' development and filming. He was originally named Adam Cochran during production, though this was ultimately changed to Jesse, at Stamos' request. Later, producers changed his last name from Cochran to one of Greek origin, to Katsopolis, also at the request of Stamos, who is Greek American. Finally, in the fifth season, it is revealed that Jesse was originally named Hermes, after his great-grandfather, but his mother changed it to Jesse at his request after he entered primary school, as his peers bullied him for his name.

Each had deceased, domineering mothers, had sealed off a room in their home as a shrine to her, and dressed in women's clothes. However, unlike Bates, Gein is not strictly considered a serial killer, having been charged with murder only twice.

Question: Which king saw the writing on the wall?
Contexts:
 1. (excerpt from article: 'Belshazzar's feast') Belshazzar's feast, or the story of the writing on the wall (chapter 5 in the Book of Daniel) tells how Belshazzar holds a great feast and drinks from the vessels that had been looted in the destruction of the First Temple. A hand appears and writes on the wall. The terrified Belshazzar calls for his wise men, but they are unable to read the writing. The queen advises him to send for Daniel, renowned for his wisdom. Daniel reminds Belshazzar that his father Nebuchadnezzar, when he became arrogant, was thrown down until he learned that God has sovereignty over the kingdom of men. Belshazzar had likewise blasphemed God, and so God sent this hand. Daniel then reads the message and interprets it: God has numbered Belshazzar's days, he has been weighed and found wanting, and his kingdom will be given to the Medes and the Persians.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'Belshazzar's feast') The constituent elements of the Book of Daniel were assembled shortly after the end of the Maccabean crisis, which is to say shortly after 164 BCE. The tales making up chapters 2 to 6 are the earliest part, dating from the late 4th or early 3rd centuries. Their setting is Babylon, and there is no reason to doubt that they were composed in the Babylonian diaspora (i.e., among the Jewish community living in Babylon and Mesopotamia under Persian and then Greek rule). They reflect a society in which foreign rulers were not necessarily malevolent (Belshazzar rewards Daniel and raises him to high office); this is a marked contrast with the visions of chapters 712, where the sufferings of the Jews are the result of actions by the evil 2nd century BCE king Antiochus IV Epiphanes.

The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and takes place in Boston, Massachusetts, of the in-game New England Commonwealth and features voiced protagonists. The Xbox One version has been confirmed to have mods . Bethesda also confirmed mods for PlayStation 4, after lengthy negotiations with Sony. A virtual reality version of the game was released on December 11, 2017.""Fallout 4"" takes place in the year 2287, ten years after the events of ""Fallout 3"". ""Fallout 4""s story begins on the day the bombs dropped: October 23, 2077. The player's character (voiced by either Brian T. Delaney or Courtenay Taylor), dubbed as the Sole Survivor, takes shelter in Vault 111, emerging 210 years later, after being subjected to suspended animation. The Sole Survivor goes on a search for their son who was taken away in the Vault.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'Fallout (series)') ""Fallout Shelter"" is a simulation game for Microsoft Windows, iOS, Android, Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. The player acts as the Overseer, building and managing their Vault and its dwellers, sending them into the Wasteland on scouting missions and defending the Vault from attacks. Unlike the main entries in the franchise, this game has no ending and mostly revolves around attempting to keep the people who live in you vault, an intricate fallout shelter, alive. The game was heavy on microtransactions, a form of in game purchases, that took the form of nuka-cola quantum, the game's ""premium"" currency, lunch boxes, an item that would give you a random mixture of in game items, pet carriers, something that would contain a pet, which can boost a single dweller's stats, and ""mister handys"", a robot who could harvest the games materials or be assigned to outside the vault to harvest bottle caps, the games currency. ""Fallout Shelter"" was released for iOS on June 14, 2015, Android on August 13, 2015, and for PC on July 15, 2016. On February 7, 2017, Bethesda launched ""Fallout Shelter"" on Xbox One.

Edgar Allan Poe later took up the idea, and considered Appalachia a much better name than America or Alleghania; he thought it better defined the United States as a distinct geographical entity, separate from the rest of the Americas, and he also thought it did honor to both Irving and the natives who the Appalachian Mountains had been named after. At the time, however, the United States had already reached far beyond the greater Appalachian region, but the ""magnificence"" of Appalachia Poe considered enough to rechristen the nation with a name that would be unique to its own character. However, Poe's popular influence only grew decades after his death, and so the name was never seriously considered.

Question: Worlds tallest flying bird mate with a single partner?
Contexts:
 1. (excerpt from article: 'Sarus crane') The nests can be more than 2 m (6 ft) in diameter and nearly 1 m (3 ft) high. Pairs show high fidelity to the nest site, often refurbishing and reusing a nest for as many as five breeding seasons. The clutch is one or two eggs (rarely three or four) which are incubated by both sexes for about 31 days (range 2635 days). Eggs are chalky white and weigh about 240 grams. When disturbed from the nest, parents may sometimes attempt to conceal the eggs by attempting to cover them with material from the edge of the nest. The eggshells are removed by the parents after the chicks hatch either by carrying away the fragments or by swallowing them. About 30% of all breeding pairs succeed in raising chicks in any year, and most of the successful pairs raise one or two chicks each, with brood sizes of three being rare. One survey in Australia found 60% of breeding pairs to have successfully fledged chicks. This high success rate is attributed to above-normal rainfall that year. The chicks are fed by the parents for the first few days, but are able to feed independently after that and follow their parents for food. When alarmed, the parent cranes use a low ""korr-rr"" call that signals chicks to freeze and lie still. Young birds stay with their parents until the subsequent breeding season. In captivity, birds breed only after their fifth year. The sarus crane is widely believed to pair for life, but cases of ""divorce"" and mate replacement have been recorded.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'Sarus crane') The sarus crane is easily distinguished from other cranes in the region by the overall grey colour and the contrasting red head and upper neck. They forage on marshes and shallow wetlands for roots, tubers, insects, crustaceans, and small vertebrate prey. Like other cranes, they form long-lasting pair bonds and maintain territories within which they perform territorial and courtship displays that include loud trumpeting, leaps, and dance-like movements. In India, they are considered symbols of marital fidelity, believed to mate for life and pine the loss of their mates even to the point of starving to death.

Question: Who was the traitor during the revolutionary war?
Contexts:
 1. (excerpt from article: 'United KingdomUnited States relations') In early 1775 the Patriots forced all the British officials and soldiers out of the new nation. The British returned in force in August 1776, and captured New York City, which became their base until the war ended in 1783. The British, using their powerful navy, could capture major ports, but 90% of the Americans lived in rural areas where they had full control. After the Patriots captured a British invasion force moving down from Canada in the Saratoga campaign of 1777, France entered the war as an ally of the US, and added the Netherlands and Spain as French allies. Britain lost naval superiority and had no major allies and few friends in Europe. The British strategy was then refocused on the South, where they expected large numbers of Loyalists would fight alongside the redcoats. Far fewer Loyalists took up arms than Britain needed; royal efforts to control the countryside in the South failed. When the British army tried to return to New York, its rescue fleet was turned back by the French fleet and its army was captured by combined French-American forces under General George Washington at the Siege of Yorktown in October 1781. That effectively ended the fighting.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'History of the United States (17761789)') Between 1776 and 1789 thirteen British colonies emerged as a new independent nation The United States of America.

Under the leadership of General George Washington, the Continental Army and Navy defeated the British military securing the independence of the thirteen colonies. In 1789, the 13 states replaced the Articles of Confederation of 1777 with the Constitution of the United States of America. With its amendments it remains the fundamental governing law of the United States today.

This was followed by another unofficial tournament the following year in Mexico, where Denmark won the title after defeating Mexico in the final. In the mid-1980s, the Mundialito was held in Italy across four editions with both Italy and England winning two titles.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'England at the FIFA World Cup') There they faced Argentina, in a very fierce game that saw Argentinian Antonio Rattin sent off by German referee Rudolf Kreitlein. Geoff Hurst scored the only goal of the game, and only his second in international football, to give England the win and a place in the semi-finals, where they faced Portugal. Two goals from Bobby Charlton gave England the lead going into the final 10 minutes of the match, before Eusebio scored from the penalty spot in the 82nd minute, the first goal England had conceded in the tournament. The final pitted England against West Germany, who took the lead in the 12th minute through Helmut Haller. Hurst equalised six minutes later, before Martin Peters gave England the lead with 12 minutes left to play; however, in the 89th minute, Wolfgang Weber levelled the scores again to take the match to extra time. In the additional period, Hurst scored twice more, the first crashing down off the crossbar before being given by linesman Tofiq Bahramov, who controversially deemed the ball to have entirely crossed the line. Hurst's three goals made him the first player to score a hat-trick in a FIFA World Cup final, a feat that (as of 2018) has not been matched since.

Question: Who was the first writer of fiction in indian english literature?
Contexts:
 1. (excerpt from article: 'Indian English literature') IEL has a relatively recent history, being only one and a half centuries old. The first book written by an Indian in English was ""Travels of Dean Mahomed"", a travel narrative by Sake Dean Mahomed published in England in 1793. In its early stages, IEL was influenced by the Western novel. Early Indian writers used English unadulterated by Indian words to convey an experience which was essentially Indian. Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay (18381894) wrote ""Rajmohan's Wife"" and published it in 1864; it is the first Indian novel written in English. Raja Rao (19082006), Indian philosopher and writer, authored ""Kanthapura"" and ""The Serpent and the Rope"", which are Indian in terms of their storytelling qualities. Kisari Mohan Ganguli translated the Mahabharata into English, the only time the epic has ever been translated in its entirety into a European language. Rabindranath Tagore (18611941) wrote in Bengali and English and was responsible for the translations of his own work into English. Dhan Gopal Mukerji (18901936) was the first Indian author to win a literary award in the United States. Nirad C. Chaudhuri (18971999), a writer of non-fiction, is best known for his ""The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian"" (1951), in which he relates his life experiences and influences. P. Lal (19292010), a poet, translator, publisher and essayist, founded a press in the 1950s for Indian English writing, Writers Workshop. Ram Nath Kak (19171993), a Kashmiri veterinarian, wrote his autobiography ""Autumn Leaves"", which is one of the most vivid portraits of life in 20th century Kashmir and has become a sort of a classic.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'Rabindranath Tagore') Bhanu Singha Thakur (Bhonita), and also known by his sobriquets Gurudev, Kabiguru, and Biswakabi, was a polymath, poet, musician, and artist from the Indian subcontinent. He reshaped Bengali literature and music, as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of the ""profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse"" of ""Gitanjali"", he became in 1913 the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his ""elegant prose and magical poetry"" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. He is sometimes referred to as ""the Bard of Bengal"".

Walsh, Timothy Shea, James Remar, Jane Leeves, Simon Jones, William Windom and Mara Wilson. It was adapted by John Hughes from the Seaton script, and directed by Les Mayfield. Due to Macy's refusal to give permission to use its name, it was replaced by the fictitious ""Cole's"". Gimbels no longer existed by 1994 so its name was replaced by the name of the fictional ""Shopper's Express"". Alvin Greenman (Alfred in the original version) played a doorman. The 1994 remake of the film had a more serious tone than the original 1947 film had and a large portion of the plot was rewritten, although the majority of both the plot and the characters remained intact. The 1994 film also added a subtext which described concerns about religious faith.

Question: The condition that exists when a contract is made with the purpose of benefiting the third party?
Contexts:
 1. (excerpt from article: 'Third-party beneficiary') A third-party beneficiary only acquires a right of action to enforce his benefit once he has accepted the benefit provided for in the contract. Under the South African interpretation, however, prior to formal acceptance of the benefit, the third-party beneficiary only has a ""spes"", or expectation; in other words, he does not have the right to accept, but rather a mere competency. Acceptance may also be a suspensive condition in certain contracts. Under Scots law, acceptance is not necessary to be vested in a right of action, but is necessary to be liable. Before acceptance, however, the ""ius quaesitum tertio"" is tenuous so that acceptance of a benefit does not create a right, but rather entrenches that right. In either case, the contracting parties may vary or rescind the contract until acceptance or reliance.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'Third-party beneficiary') A third-party beneficiary, in the law of contracts, is a person who may have the right to sue on a contract, despite not having originally been an active party to the contract. This right, known as a ""ius quaesitum tertio"", arises when the third party (""tertius"" or ""alteri"") is the intended beneficiary of the contract, as opposed to a mere incidental beneficiary (""penitus extraneus""). It vests when the third party relies on or assents to the relationship, and gives the third party the right to sue either the promisor (""promittens"", or performing party) or the promisee (""stipulans"", or anchor party) of the contract, depending on the circumstances under which the relationship was created.

Question: Whats it called when fresh and saltwater meet?
Contexts:
 1. (excerpt from article: 'Saltwater intrusion') Groundwater extraction is the primary cause of saltwater intrusion. Groundwater is the main source of drinking water in many coastal areas of the United States, and extraction has increased over time. Under baseline conditions, the inland extent of saltwater is limited by higher pressure exerted by the freshwater column, owing to its higher elevation. Groundwater extraction can lower the level of the freshwater table, reducing the pressure exerted by the freshwater column and allowing the denser saltwater to move inland laterally. In Cape May, New Jersey, since the 1940s water withdrawals have lowered groundwater levels by up to 30 meters, reducing the water table to below sea level and causing widespread intrusion and contamination of water supply wells.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'Brackish water') Brackish water condition commonly occurs when fresh water meets seawater. In fact, the most extensive brackish water habitats worldwide are estuaries, where a river meets the sea.
 3. (excerpt from article: 'Saltwater intrusion') Saltwater intrusion is the movement of saline water into freshwater aquifers, which can lead to groundwater quality degradation, including drinking water sources, and other consequences. Saltwater intrusion can naturally occur in coastal aquifers, owing to the hydraulic connection between groundwater and seawater. Because saline water has a higher mineral content than freshwater, it is denser and has a higher water pressure. As a result, saltwater can push inland beneath the freshwater. Certain human activities, especially groundwater pumping from coastal freshwater wells, have increased saltwater intrusion in many coastal areas. Water extraction drops the level of fresh groundwater, reducing its water pressure and allowing saltwater to flow further inland. Other contributors to saltwater intrusion include navigation channels or agricultural and drainage channels, which provide conduits for saltwater to move inland. Sea level rise could also contribute to saltwater intrusion. Saltwater intrusion can also be worsened by extreme events like hurricane storm surges.
 4. (excerpt from article: 'Brackish water') This type of ecological succession from a freshwater to marine ecosystem is typical of river estuaries. River estuaries form important staging points during the migration of anadromous and catadromous fish species, such as salmon, shad, and eels, giving them time to form social groups and to adjust to the changes in salinity. Salmon are anadromous, meaning they live in the sea but ascend rivers to spawn; eels are catadromous, living in rivers and streams, but returning to the sea to breed. Besides the species that migrate through estuaries, there are many other fish that use them as ""nursery grounds"" for spawning or as places young fish can feed and grow before moving elsewhere. Herring and plaice are two commercially important species that use the Thames Estuary for this purpose.

 1. (excerpt from article: 'Louisiana Purchase') In Saint-Domingue, Leclerc's forces took Louverture prisoner, but their expedition soon faltered in the face of fierce resistance and disease. By early 1803, Napoleon decided to abandon his plans to rebuild France's New World empire. Without sufficient revenues from sugar colonies in the Caribbean, Louisiana had little value to him. Spain had not yet completed the transfer of Louisiana to France, and war between France and the UK was imminent. Out of anger towards Spain and the unique opportunity to sell something that was useless and not truly his yet, Napoleon decided to sell the entire territory.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'Louisiana Purchase') The Kingdom of France had controlled the Louisiana territory from 1699 until it was ceded to Spain in 1762. In 1800, Napoleon, then the First Consul of the French Republic, regained ownership of Louisiana as part of a broader project to re-establish a French colonial empire in North America. However, France's failure to put down a revolt in Saint-Domingue, coupled with the prospect of renewed warfare with the United Kingdom, prompted Napoleon to consider selling Louisiana to the United States. Acquisition of Louisiana was a long-term goal of President Thomas Jefferson, who was especially eager to gain control of the crucial Mississippi River port of New Orleans. Jefferson tasked James Monroe and Robert R. Livingston with purchasing New Orleans. Negotiating with French Treasury Minister Francois Barbe-Marbois (who was acting on behalf of Napoleon), the American representatives quickly agreed to purchase the entire territory of Louisiana after it was offered. Overcoming the opposition of the Federalist Party, Jefferson and Secretary of State James Madison convinced Congress to ratify and fund the Louisiana Purchase.

I started in hip hop music back in the 90s and I never expected to be singing and have an actual career as a musician, but I'm travelling all over the world and I thought 'Life is a dream, wake me up when it's all over'. I was invited to the studio with Avicii and Mike Einziger from Incubus, and when I got to the studio they had already come up with a chord progression of the song. I came in with the lyrics and I just developed the melody as I heard the chords, and we all thought it was something very strong. We finished the song that night as an acoustic version, then Avicii made the dance mix in a couple of days, and that's what we released to the world, and that was his release."" Blacc later released an acoustic version of the song which was included on his solo EP ""Wake Me Up"". It was also released as a promotional stand-alone single by Interscope Records and made available online for download via iTunes. The single also charted in its right in various charts.

 2. (excerpt from article: 'Filet-O-Fish') In November 2007, McDonald's lowered the use of New Zealand hoki and increased the use of Alaskan pollock, due to declining New Zealand hoki fishery sustainability and large cutbacks in the total allowable commercial catch of hoki by the New Zealand Ministry of Fisheries - from 250,000 tonnes in 1997 to 90,000 tonnes in 2007. McDonald's originally used Atlantic cod, before declining cod catches forced McDonald's to find sustainable fish elsewhere. McDonald's is trying to maintain fish only from areas certified as sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council, but that is becoming more difficult each year. Hoki is still a major ingredient.

Question: When did the modern venture capital industry in the usa most likely begin?
Contexts:
 1. (excerpt from article: 'Venture capital') One of the first steps toward a professionally managed venture capital industry was the passage of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. The 1958 Act officially allowed the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to license private ""Small Business Investment Companies"" (SBICs) to help the financing and management of the small entrepreneurial businesses in the United States. The Small Business Investment Act of 1958 provided tax breaks that helped contribute to the rise of private equity firms.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'Venture capital') It is commonly noted that the first venture-backed startup is Fairchild Semiconductor (which produced the first commercially practical integrated circuit), funded in 1959 by what would later become Venrock Associates. Venrock was founded in 1969 by Laurance S. Rockefeller, the fourth of John D. Rockefeller's six children, as a way to allow other Rockefeller children to develop exposure to venture capital investments.
 3. (excerpt from article: 'Venture capital') Georges Doriot, the ""father of venture capitalism"" (and former assistant dean of Harvard Business School), founded the graduate business school INSEAD in 1957. Along with Ralph Flanders and Karl Compton (former president of MIT), Doriot founded ARDC in 1946 to encourage private-sector investment in businesses run by soldiers returning from World War II. ARDC became the first institutional private-equity investment firm to raise capital from sources other than wealthy families, although it had several notable investment successes as well. ARDC is credited with the first trick when its 1957 investment of $70,000 in Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) would be valued at over $355 million after the company's initial public offering in 1968 (representing a return of over 1200 times on its investment and an annualized rate of return of 101%).

It was adapted by Jeb Rosebrook from the George Seaton screenplay, and directed by Fielder Cook. Mrs. Walker's first name is changed to Karen in this version. This would prove to be the final version in which the department store was actually Macy's. David Doyle, who played R. H.

Due to Macy's refusal to give permission to use its name, it was replaced by the fictitious ""Cole's"". Gimbels no longer existed by 1994 so its name was replaced by the name of the fictional ""Shopper's Express"". Alvin Greenman (Alfred in the original version) played a doorman. The 1994 remake of the film had a more serious tone than the original 1947 film had and a large portion of the plot was rewritten, although the majority of both the plot and the characters remained intact. The 1994 film also added a subtext which described concerns about religious faith.

Question: When was the american civil liberties union formed?
Contexts:
 1. (excerpt from article: 'American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey') The ACLU-NJ was founded on June 16, 1960, when North Jersey- and South Jersey-based ACLU members convened in Newark to officially form a statewide affiliate. In its first decade, the ACLU-NJ formed the Community Legal Action Workshop (CLAW) to advocate for inner-city victims of civil liberties violations in light of the Newark riots. Volunteer ACLU attorneys Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Annamay Sheppard, both of Rutgers School of LawNewark at the time, argued the 1972 sex discrimination case of Abbe Seldin, who won her right to play tennis on the Teaneck High School men's team.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'American Civil Liberties Union') The CLB directors concurred, and on January 19, 1920, they formed an organization under a new name, the American Civil Liberties Union. Although a handful of other organizations in the United States at that time focused on civil rights, such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the ACLU was the first that did not represent a particular group of persons, or a single theme. Like the CLB, the NAACP pursued litigation to work on civil rights, including efforts to overturn the disfranchisement of African Americans in the South that had taken place since the turn of the century.

 1. (excerpt from article: 'History of the United States (17761789)') Between 1776 and 1789 thirteen British colonies emerged as a new independent nation The United States of America. Fighting in the American Revolutionary War started between colonial militias and the British Army in 1775. The Second Continental Congress issued the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. Under the leadership of General George Washington, the Continental Army and Navy defeated the British military securing the independence of the thirteen colonies. In 1789, the 13 states replaced the Articles of Confederation of 1777 with the Constitution of the United States of America. With its amendments it remains the fundamental governing law of the United States today.
 2. (excerpt from article: 'History of the United States (17761789)') On July 2, 1776, the Second Continental Congress, still meeting in Philadelphia, voted unanimously to declare the independence as the ""United States of America"". Two days later, on July 4, Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence. The drafting of the Declaration was the responsibility of a Committee of Five, which included, among others, John Adams and Benjamin Franklin; it was drafted by Thomas Jefferson and revised by the others and the Congress as a whole. It contended that ""all men are created equal"" with ""certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"", and that ""to secure these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed"", as well as listing the main colonial grievances against the crown.

Question: What is the snowman's name in frozen?
Contexts:
 1. (excerpt from article: 'Olaf (Frozen)') As a snowman Anna and Elsa built together as kids, Olaf represents innocent love and the joy the sisters once had when they were young before being split. He is not just funny, he's also got a ""big role to play representing the innocent love in the scale of fear versus love."" It wasn't until he meant something to the girls that he resonated with us,"" ""Olaf couldn't just be thrown in, he had to have a purpose"" and that one of his purposes was to be the embodiment of the sisterly relationship that had gone cold. ""When Anna and Elsa were very little, and before Elsa's powers accidentally hurt Anna, they played. They'd sneak away and play with her powers. And you see them roll the snowman. He's not magical. He doesn't come to life. But they name him Olaf and he likes warm hugs."" ""It inspires the look. And so when Elsa is singing Let It Go obviously the first thing she goes to is the last moment she was happy. And it was that moment. And so he's imbued with that. He's innocent love."" The continuous themes that can be seen throughout the movie revolve around the power of love and fear. Olaf, on one end of that spectrum, represents the most innocent kind form of love. It is possible that he resembles some of the characteristics of Anna's younger self. This provides a connection between the sisters' happy past and their ability to remember that love in difficult times. Overall his character provides much of the comic relief found in the film, while conveying lovable innocence and purity. ""And so he was just a lot of fun, and emotionally hell bring a lot that we werent able to show you yet, too. So hes funny in the kids-state-the-obvious kind of way."" (Lee) ""And he can say very poignant things too."" (Buck)

The R32 GT-R also had success in the Australian Touring Car Championship helping the R31 Skyline GTS-R to victory in 1990 and winning alone in 1991 and 1992, until a regulation change excluded the GT-R in 1993.
 3. (excerpt from article: 'Nissan Skyline GT-R') Following the end of R34 production in 2002, Nissan announced they would separate the GT-R model from the Skyline name, creating an entirely new vehiclethough based on the same platform as the Skyline.

 2. (excerpt from article: 'Seawater desalination in Australia') Australias first desalination plant was constructed in 1903 to treat saline groundwater in the gold fields of Western Australia at Kalgoorlie. Several desalination plants were built in Australia between 1960 and 1980, especially following the revolution in membrane technology that made reverse osmosis economically viable, but vapor-compression desalination and multi-stage flash distillation plants were also built. By 2002, however, only two reverse osmosis desalination plants were still operating, one on Kangaroo Island and the other on Rottnest Island. Seawater reverse osmosis is the only type of desalination technology currently used for large-scale desalination plants in Australia, the most important of these plants being located in Perth and Sydney.
 3. (excerpt from article: 'Multi-stage flash distillation') Multi-stage flash distillation (MSF) is a water desalination process that distills sea water by flashing a portion of the water into steam in multiple stages of what are essentially countercurrent heat exchangers. Multi-stage flash distillation plants produce about 26% of all desalinated water in the world, but today virtually all new desalination plants use reverse osmosis due to much lower energy consumption.

When Bryant was back and playing over 38 minutes a game, he had an increase in all statistical categories during the 19992000 season. This included leading the team in assists per game and steals per game. The duo of O'Neal and Bryant backed with a strong bench led to the Lakers winning 67 games, tied for fifth-most in NBA history. This followed with O'Neal winning the MVP and Bryant being named to the All-NBA Team Second Team and All-NBA Defensive Team for the first time in his career (the youngest player ever to receive defensive honors). While playing second fiddle to O'Neal in the playoffs, Bryant had some clutch performances including a 25-point, 11 rebound, 7 assist, 4 block game in game 7 of the Western Conference finals against the Portland Trail Blazers. He also threw an alley-oop pass to O'Neal to clinch the game and the series. In the 2000 Finals against the Indiana Pacers, Bryant injured his ankle in the second quarter of Game 2 after landing on the Pacers' Jalen Rose's foot. Rose later admitted he placed his foot under Bryant intentionally. Bryant did not return to the game, and he also missed Game 3 due to the injury.

The timeline for the musical is yet to be announced. In June 2017, John appeared in the award-winning documentary ""The American Epic Sessions"", directed by Bernard MacMahon. In the film, he recorded live on the restored first electrical sound recording system from the 1920s.

After the release of ""The Lion King"" soundtrack, the album remained at the top of ""Billboard"" 200 for nine weeks. On 10 November 1999, the RIAA certified ""The Lion King"" ""Diamond"" for selling 15million copies.
 3. (excerpt from article: 'Elton John') In November 1977, John announced he was retiring from performing; Taupin began collaborating with others. Now producing only one album a year, John issued ""A Single Man"" in 1978 with a new lyricist, Gary Osborne; the album produced no singles that made the top 20 in the US, but the two singles from the album released in the UK, ""Part-Time Love"" and ""Song for Guy"", both made the top 20 there, with the latter reaching the top 5. In 1979, accompanied by Ray Cooper, John became one of the first Western artists to tour the Soviet Union and Israel. John returned to the US top ten with ""Mama Can't Buy You Love"" (number 9), a song MCA rejected in 1977, recorded with Philadelphia soul producer Thom Bell. John said Bell was the first person to give him voice lessons and encouraged him to sing in a lower register. A disco-influenced album, ""Victim of Love"", was poorly received. In 1979, John and Taupin reunited, though they did not collaborate on a full album until 1983's ""Too Low For Zero"". ""21 at 33"", released the following year, was a significant career boost, aided by his biggest hit in four years, ""Little Jeannie"" (number 3 US), with the lyrics by Gary Osborne.
 4. (excerpt from article: 'Your Song') One widespread story is that Bernie Taupin wrote the song's lyrics after breakfast one morning on the roof of 20 Denmark Street, London, where John worked for a music publishing firm as an office boy, hence the line ""I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss.""

Amy is a companion of the series protagonist the Doctor, in his eleventh incarnation, played by Matt Smith. She appears in the programme from the fifth series (2010) to midway through the seventh series (2012).
 2. (excerpt from article: 'The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)') The young Amy, known as Amelia, was played by Karen Gillan's real-life cousin Caitlin Blackwood. Though Gillan recommended Blackwood, the young actor first had to undergo rigorous auditions, lacking any formal acting experience. ""The Eleventh Hour"" was also the debut of Arthur Darvill as Rory Williams, who became a regular in the sixth series. Moffat stated that what stood out about Darvill's audition was ""just how funny"" he was. ""EastEnders"" star Nina Wadia was chosen for the part of the doctor at the Leadworth Hospital. Wadia speculated that she was cast because she had worked with Adam Smith before. Patrick Moore appears as himself in the video conference with a brief speaking part, though not all his lines survived the final cut. The man above Moore is the brother of Adam Smith. Marcello Magni, who played a man Prisoner Zero impersonates that barks like his dog, had already worked as a canine impersonator. Academy Award-winning actor Olivia Colman and ""The Umbrella Academy"" star Tom Hopper make pre-stardom appearances in small roles (as one of Prisoner Zeros forms, and Jeff, respectively).

Each poster showed the slogan under a representation of a ""Tudor Crown"" (a symbol of the state).

It has since been re-issued by a number of private companies, and has been used as the decorative theme for a range of products.
